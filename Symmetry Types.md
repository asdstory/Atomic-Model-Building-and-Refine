### Symmetry of homomers

Homomers are very abundant in nature and also in 3D Complex, where they account for 90% of the complexes. They can be separated into two main classes of open or closed symmetry. The first class corresponds to open structures that would polymerize to infinity in the absence of limiting factors (not shown here). Such assemblies (e.g. tubulin and actin) are rare in 3D Complex (3%), most likely due to their innate dynamic character rendering them difficult to crystallize. By contrast closed symmetries are finite in space, and most homomers adopt either cyclic or dihedral symmetry (shown in Figure), with only a small fraction (1%) with cubic symmetry like virus' capsids (not shown). In 3D Complex we denote Cn a cyclic complex containing n subunits, and Dn as a dihedral complex containing 2*n subunits. In the figure, dotted lines with elipses, triangles, square and pentagons represent 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5- fold symmetry axes respectively.
